# vscode-config

My VSCode configuration, including settings and keybindings.

Minimalistic and aesthetic vscode configuration, strongly inspired by Caleb Porzio's [Make VS Code awesome](https://makevscodeawesome.com/) âœ¨

Used fonts are [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono) and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

(Some settings are for Laravel development)
